# Phase 3: Services Section - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-08
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Present 5 barbershop services (Classic Haircut, Fade/Skin Fade, Line Work & Details, Beard Trim & Shaping, Hot Towel Shave) with compelling descriptions and premium imagery. No pricing displayed. Each service gets a Book Now CTA. Built as a scroll section on the main page.

## Implementation Decisions

### Service descriptions & tone
- Luxury & atmospheric tone — evocative language that sells the experience, not the task (e.g., "Precision blade work with hot lather finish")
- Each service card has its own gold "Book Now" CTA button linking to Booksy
- Description length at Claude's discretion — pick the right length per service based on what needs to be said

### Visual design & layout
- Full creative freedom on card layout, image treatment, and overall section composition
- Push for bold, cinematic, and creative visual design — not safe/standard card grids
- Explore unconventional layouts: 3D elements, motion mockups, dramatic compositions
- The goal is to make people stop scrolling — premium and unforgettable

### Motion & animation
- Bold & cinematic level — dramatic scroll reveals, 3D card interactions, morphing transitions
- Not subtle — this section should be a visual event
- Framer Motion is available in the stack for animation

### Section transition
- Claude's discretion on whether the section creates a distinct visual break (background shift, divider animation) or flows seamlessly from About

### Claude's Discretion
- Card layout structure (top-image, overlay, split, or something unconventional)
- Image aspect ratio and treatment (overlays, gradients, crops)
- Whether Hot Towel Shave gets a "signature" badge or special visual treatment
- Description length per service
- Section entry transition style
- Placeholder image selection during build (client will provide real photos later)
- Any 3D or particle effects that enhance without overwhelming

</decisions>

## Specific Ideas

- User explicitly asked for maximum creativity — "be as creative as possible when it comes to layout and images"
- Mentioned wanting animations, motion mockups, or even 3D elements
- "Surprise me" — no design references given, full creative license
- Real client photos will replace placeholders later, so image containers should accommodate swapping
- The black (#1a1a1a) + gold (#d4af37) palette should anchor the design but not limit creative exploration
