<objective>
Build the Services section with 5 barbershop service cards in a bold, cinematic asymmetric grid layout with 3D hover interactions and scroll-triggered stagger animations.

Purpose: This is the core offering showcase. Users need to see what the shop provides and be compelled to book. The layout should feel premium and unconventional -- not a standard card grid.
Output: Fully interactive Services section rendered on the homepage with placeholder images, luxury descriptions, and individual Book Now CTAs per card.

  <action>
    1. Add a SERVICES array to src/lib/constants.ts with 5 service objects. Each object has:
       - id: string slug (e.g., "classic-haircut")
       - title: string (e.g., "Classic Haircut")
       - description: 2-3 sentences, luxury/atmospheric tone. NO pricing. Evoke the experience.
       - image: path to placeholder image (e.g., "/images/services/classic-haircut.jpg")
       - signature: boolean (true only for Hot Towel Shave)

    Services:
    - Classic Haircut: Emphasize precision, consultation, the ritual of a proper haircut
    - Fade / Skin Fade: Emphasize seamless blending, artistry, modern craftsmanship
    - Line Work & Details: Emphasize sharp edges, architectural precision, finishing touches
    - Beard Trim & Shaping: Emphasize sculpting, grooming expertise, clean lines
    - Hot Towel Shave (signature: true): Emphasize the full sensory experience, hot lather, straight razor, premium relaxation

    2. Download 5 high-quality barbershop placeholder images from Unsplash to public/images/services/:
       - Use curl to download from Unsplash source URLs (800x600 or similar landscape ratio)
       - classic-haircut.jpg: search "barber haircut" or similar
       - fade.jpg: search "barber fade haircut"
       - line-work.jpg: search "barber detail work" or "barber lineup"
       - beard-trim.jpg: search "barber beard trim"
       - hot-towel-shave.jpg: search "barber hot towel shave" or "straight razor shave"
       - Use URLs like: https://images.unsplash.com/photo-XXXX?w=800&q=80
       - If any download fails, create a simple placeholder or try alternate Unsplash photos

    Type the SERVICES array as `as const` for type safety, matching the pattern used by other constants.
  </action>
  <verify>
    - grep for "SERVICES" in src/lib/constants.ts confirms array exists with 5 items
    - ls public/images/services/ shows 5 .jpg files with non-zero size
    - No pricing strings (no "$", no "price", no dollar amounts) in the SERVICES descriptions
  </verify>
  <done>
    SERVICES array exported from constants.ts with 5 service objects (id, title, description, image, signature). 5 placeholder images downloaded to public/images/services/. Zero pricing information anywhere.

  <name>Task 2: Build Services section component with cinematic layout and 3D hover</name>
  <files>
    src/components/sections/Services.tsx
    src/components/sections/index.ts
    src/app/page.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
    Create src/components/sections/Services.tsx as a "use client" component:

    **Section Header:**
    - Gold uppercase tracking label "Our Craft" (or similar atmospheric label)
    - Large Playfair Display heading "Services"
    - Optional 1-line subheading in muted text

    **Asymmetric Grid Layout (NOT a uniform card grid):**
    - Use CSS Grid with 12 columns on desktop
    - Row 1: Card 1 spans col 1-7, Card 2 spans col 8-12 (or 7/5 split)
    - Row 2: Card 3 spans col 1-5, Card 4 spans col 6-12 (or 5/7 split)
    - Row 3: Hot Towel Shave (signature) spans full 12 columns -- this is the signature service, give it a wider, more cinematic presentation (landscape image, larger text, or different visual treatment)
    - On tablet (md): 2 columns, signature still full-width
    - On mobile: single column stack

    **Each Service Card Contains:**
    - Next/Image with the service placeholder photo (fill mode, object-cover, lazy loading)
    - Overlay gradient (dark from bottom for text readability)
    - Service title in Playfair Display
    - Description text in Inter
    - Gold "Book Now" button using the existing Button component with href={BOOKSY_URL} and variant="outline" or "primary" (size="sm")

    **3D Mouse-Tracking Hover (desktop only):**
    - Use framer-motion useMotionValue and useTransform for mouse position tracking
    - On mouse move over card: calculate rotateX and rotateY based on mouse position relative to card center
    - Subtle tilt: max ~8-10 degrees rotation
    - Add perspective: 1000px to parent or card container
    - On mouse leave: animate back to rotateX: 0, rotateY: 0
    - Detect touch devices using a media query or check and DISABLE 3D hover on mobile/touch (per research recommendation)

    **Scroll-Triggered Stagger Animations:**
    - Use framer-motion whileInView with viewport={{ once: true, amount: 0.2 }}
    - Cards fade up + slight scale from 0.95 to 1
    - Use staggerChildren: 0.15 on the parent variants
    - The signature card can have a slightly different entrance (maybe scale from wider or fade in with a gold border animation)

    **Styling Notes:**
    - Card backgrounds: bg-primary-black-900 or bg-primary-black-950
    - Image aspect ratio: roughly 4:3 or 3:2, taller for portrait-oriented cards
    - Ensure cards have rounded-sm corners matching site aesthetic
    - Add a subtle gold border or gold accent on hover (complement the 3D tilt)

    Then update src/components/sections/index.ts to add:
    export { default as Services } from "./Services";

    Then update src/app/page.tsx:
    - Import Services from "@/components/sections"
    - Replace the entire Services placeholder Section block (the one with id="services" containing the placeholder text and empty div) with just: <Services />
    - Keep all other sections exactly as they are
  </action>
  <verify>
    - npm run build --prefix "C:/Users/Administrator/old-fashion-barbershop" completes without errors
    - grep for "use client" in Services.tsx confirms client component
    - grep for "BOOKSY_URL" in Services.tsx confirms Book Now links are wired
    - grep for "useMotionValue" in Services.tsx confirms 3D hover is implemented
    - grep for "whileInView" in Services.tsx confirms scroll animations
    - grep for "Services" in src/components/sections/index.ts confirms barrel export
    - grep for "Services" in src/app/page.tsx confirms component is rendered
    - No pricing strings in Services.tsx
  </verify>
  <done>
    Services.tsx renders all 5 service cards in an asymmetric grid with 3D mouse-tracking hover on desktop, scroll-triggered stagger animations, individual gold Book Now CTAs linking to BOOKSY_URL, and Hot Towel Shave signature treatment. Component is exported and rendered on the homepage. Build passes clean.
